### Western Australia Busselton, Western Australia

Dec 7th 2014IRONMAN

#### A stalwart of the Asia Pacific triathlon scene since 2004, SunSmart IRONMAN Western Australia takes place in the scenic town of Busselton, in the south-west region of the vast state of Western Australia.

Incorporating the iconic Busselton Jetty, IRONMAN Western Australia is renowned worldwide for being the place to go for a personal best, with the bike and run courses amongst the flattest on the global IRONMAN circuit. [More about the course][1].

Since its debut on the Australian calendar in 2004 the IRONMAN event has seen tremendous growth, both in size and reputation among the triathlon community, and widely recognised globally as a world class sporting event. The event has become enormously popular with athletes and spectators alike and is renowned as a spectacular destination race and holiday venue. A tribute to the City and people of Busselton who support and contribute to the huge success the event has become.

A fitting tribute to the events milestone anniversary, it was awarded top honours in the Major Festival and Events category in the Perth Airport Western Australian Tourism Awards in November 2013 and nominated as a finalist in the Australian awards announced in February 2014.
